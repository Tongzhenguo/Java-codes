 * Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.


 OJ's undirected graph serialization:
 Nodes are labeled uniquely.

 We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.
 As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.

 The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.

 First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
 Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
 Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.
 Visually, the graph looks like the following:

 1
 / \
 /   \
 0 --- 2
 / \
 \_/

            clone.neighbors.add(clone(neighbor));
