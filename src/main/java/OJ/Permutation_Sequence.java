 * Created by Tongzhenguo on 2017/6/19.
 * The set [1,2,3,…,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
 给出集合 [1,2,3,…,n]，其所有元素共有 n! 种排列。

 By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
 We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):
 按大小顺序列出所有排列情况，并一一标记，当 n = 3 时, 所有排列如下：

 "123"
 "132"
 "213"
 "231"
 "312"
 "321"
 Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.
 给定 n 和 k，返回第 k 个排列。

 Note: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
 说明：
 给定 n 的范围是 [1, 9]。
 给定 k 的范围是[1,  n!]。

public class Permutation_Sequence {
    /**
     * say n = 4, you have {1, 2, 3, 4}

     If you were to list out all the permutations you have

     1 + (permutations of 2, 3, 4)

     2 + (permutations of 1, 3, 4)

     3 + (permutations of 1, 2, 4)

     4 + (permutations of 1, 2, 3)


     We know how to calculate the number of permutations of n numbers... n!
     So each of those with permutations of 3 numbers means there are 6 possible permutations.
     Meaning there would be a total of 24 permutations in this particular one. So if you were to look for the (k = 14) 14th permutation,
     it would be in the 3 + (permutations of 1, 2, 4) subset.

     To programmatically get that, you take k = 13 (subtract 1 because of things always starting at 0) and divide that by the 6 we got from the factorial,
     which would give you the index of the number you want. In the array {1, 2, 3, 4}, k/(n-1)! = 13/(4-1)! = 13/3! = 13/6 = 2. The array {1, 2, 3, 4} has a value of 3 at index 2.
     So the first number is a 3.

     Then the problem repeats with less numbers.

     The permutations of {1, 2, 4} would be:

     1 + (permutations of 2, 4)

     2 + (permutations of 1, 4)

     4 + (permutations of 1, 2)

     But our k is no longer the 14th, because in the previous step, we've already eliminated the 12 4-number permutations starting with 1 and 2.
     So you subtract 12 from k.. which gives you 1. Programmatically that would be...

     k = k - (index from previous) * (n-1)! = k - 2*(n-1)! = 13 - 2*(3)! = 1

     In this second step, permutations of 2 numbers has only 2 possibilities, meaning each of the three permutations listed above a has two possibilities, giving a total of 6. We're looking for the first one, so that would be in the 1 + (permutations of 2, 4) subset.

     Meaning: index to get number from is k / (n - 2)! = 1 / (4-2)! = 1 / 2! = 0.. from {1, 2, 4}, index 0 is 1


     so the numbers we have so far is 3, 1... and then repeating without explanations.


     {2, 4}

     k = k - (index from pervious) * (n-2)! = k - 0 * (n - 2)! = 1 - 0 = 1;

     third number's index = k / (n - 3)! = 1 / (4-3)! = 1/ 1! = 1... from {2, 4}, index 1 has 4

     Third number is 4


     {2}

     k = k - (index from pervious) * (n - 3)! = k - 1 * (4 - 3)! = 1 - 1 = 0;

     third number's index = k / (n - 4)! = 0 / (4-4)! = 0/ 1 = 0... from {2}, index 0 has 2

     Fourth number is 2
