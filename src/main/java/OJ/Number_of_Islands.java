/**
 * Created by arachis on 2017/8/14.
 * Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands.
 * An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
 * You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 Example 1:

 11110
 11010
 11000
 00000
 Answer: 1

 Example 2:

 11000
 11000
 00100
 00011
 Answer: 3
