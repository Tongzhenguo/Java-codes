 * You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend:
 * There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones.
 * The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.
 * Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game.
 * Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.
 * For example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove,
 * the last stone will always be removed by your friend.
 * 翻译过来就是给两人一堆石头，由你开始两人轮流拿一到三块石头，谁最后拿不到石头为输；
 * 写一个函数，判断给定石头数n,你是否能赢
