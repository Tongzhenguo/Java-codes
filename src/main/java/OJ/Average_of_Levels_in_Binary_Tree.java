 *
 * Given a non-empty binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.

 Example 1:
 Input:
 3
 / \
 9  20
 /  \
 15   7
 Output: [3, 14.5, 11]
 Explanation:
 The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3,  on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11. Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].
 Note:
 The range of node's value is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.
